# The "ok" script
 
This is just my ubuntu "after install" script.
 
It runs everything that I normally run just after installing ubuntu or some
other ubuntu-based distro, it unninstalls apps that I don't like, installs some 
others that I always use and also sets some configurations that I use for
neovim, zsh and probably others.
 
To run, copy and paste this command in your terminal.
 
```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/saturnoluis/ok-script/main/ok-script.py >> ok-run.py && python3 ok-run.py
```
 
Really, please don't run this if at least you haven't read the `ok-script.py`
file and understand what it does. This script does a bunch of things that you
don't probably want to do to your system.
