# The "ok" script
 
This script is meant for use after installing Ubuntu or any other Ubuntu-based distribution. It automates the tasks I typically perform post-installation, including uninstalling unwanted apps, installing essential ones, and setting configurations for tools such as Neovim, Zsh, and others.

To run the script, please copy and paste the following command in your terminal:
 
```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/saturnoluis/ok-script/main/ok-script.py >> ok-run.py && python3 ok-run.py
```
 
*STOP!*: Don't run this, if you're interested, please take the time to thoroughly read the ok-script.py file before running the script to ensure you understand what actions will be performed on your system. Running the script could result in unintended consequences, as it performs a significant number of operations on your system.
