# The "ok" script

This is the script I run to set-up my Fedora Workstation after a
fresh install, it updates the system, installs tools and apps that
I use, uninstall a few ones that I don't use, and sets my "dotfiles".

To run the script:
 
```bash
wget -N https://raw.githubusercontent.com/saturnoluis/ok-script/script-to-bash/ok-script.sh && ./ok-script.sh
```
*Wait!*: This script is for my personal use, sure you can run it
in your own system but I don't think you really should, feel
free to ask me anything about this if you're interested.
