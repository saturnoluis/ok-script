 16 # The "ok" script
 15  
 14 This is just my ubuntu "after install" script.
 13  
 12 It runs everything that I normally run just after installing ubuntu or some
 11 other ubuntu-based distro, it unninstalls apps that I don't like, installs some 
 10 others that I always use and also sets some configurations that I use for
  9 neovim, zsh and probably others.

  7 To run, copy and paste this command in your terminal.

  5 `curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/saturnoluis/ok-script/main/ok-script.py
  4 >> ok-run.py && python3 ok-run.py`

  2 Really, please don't run this if at least you haven't read the `ok-script.py`
  1 file and understand what it does. This script does a bunch of things that you
17  don't probably want to do to your system.
