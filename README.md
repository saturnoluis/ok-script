# The "ok" script
 
This script is meant for use after installing Fedora Workstation 38+.
It automates for me the tasks I typically perform post-installation,
including uninstalling unwanted apps, installing essential ones, and setting
configurations for tools such as Neovim, Zsh, and others.

To run the script, copy and paste the following command in your terminal:
 
```bash
wget -N https://raw.githubusercontent.com/saturnoluis/ok-script/main/ok-script.py && python3 ok-script.py
```
 
*STOP!*: Don't run this, if you're interested, please take the time to
thoroughly read the ok-script.py file before running the script to ensure you
understand what actions will be performed on your system. Running the script
could result in unintended consequences, as it performs a significant number of
operations on your system.
